# Stage A — manual verification record

## 2026-05-26 — original 5-blocker verification

The five-blocker Stage A landed with `b873a00`. Automated suites all
green (102 backend tests, 31 frontend tests, 91 % backend coverage,
`mypy --strict`, `ruff`, `eslint`, `tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm i18n:check`).
Hands-on two-device verification then ran the 11-step protocol from
`docs/testing.md` § "Two-device verification" and uncovered **six more
defects** that were fixed in the same stage rather than punted forward
(per the closing rule now in `docs/roadmap.md`):

| # | Step (testing.md) | Outcome | Fix landed in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Device A: menu button → Quick Wheel → spin | ✅ | — |
| 2 | Settled → `+ Invite friends` visible | ❌ CTA only appeared post-settle, not on idle | `bfdca38` |
| 3 | Tap Share → recipient sees deep link | ❌ env vars not piped through `docker-compose.yml`; Direct Link form built but never enabled at runtime | `6b72946` |
| 4 | Device B: tap deep link | ✅ once env wiring + short-name alignment landed | `0756782` (rename) |
| 5 | Lands directly in `/room/<CODE>` | ✅ | `b873a00` (start_param SDK→hash→query) |
| 6 | Presence list grows on Device A | ✅ | — |
| 7 | Spin from Device A → both wheels animate in sync | ❌ hub on Device A (the host) refused to fire — `onSpinClick` not wired in RoomPage + `SPIN` hub label hardcoded English | `d425a7a` |
| 7b | Host-detection (who is allowed to spin) | ❌ client compared Telegram tg_id to internal user_id; host always treated as guest | `7db1b0a` (added `me_user_id` to RoomState) |
| 8 | Confetti + brand reveal | ✅ | — |
| 9 | Device B reaction → flying emoji on both | ✅ | — |
| 10 | Rate-limit at 11th reaction in 30 s | ✅ | — |
| 11 | UK locale flip is total | ❌ multiple Ukrainian strings were awkward translations + missing ICU plurals for participant count | `4efb510` |
| — | Doc structure for new contributors | ❌ README was a wall of text mixing landing-page and dev-setup content | `6ef70a4` (split into `architecture.md` / `development.md` / `testing.md`) |
| — | Default spin policy social fit | ❌ `host_only` discourages party-game play; flipped to `anyone` | `00f3c21` (Alembic `0003`) |

After all six fixes landed, the 11-step protocol re-ran end-to-end on
real devices (iPhone + Android, EN + UK) without further regressions.
Stage A formally closed in `12ce234`.

## 2026-05-27 — close-out batch (this commit set)

Post-close-out review surfaced **two more user-observable defects** the
original verification missed because both are subtle interaction-state
bugs that only become obvious after multiple spins in a single session.
Per the same closing rule (verification findings stay in their stage),
they were fixed in Stage A:

| # | Observation | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | Hub button (the centerpiece of the wheel) was dead after the first spin: state advanced `idle → spinning → settled` and only the secondary button below the wheel could revive it. Closing the result overlay left users staring at an inert centerpiece. | `31a23e8` — `isHubInteractive()` helper + state-machine relaxation |
| 13 | In `host_only` rooms, the hub kept the `SPIN` label + breath animation for non-host guests because `Wheel.tsx` ignored whether `onSpinClick` was wired. | Same commit — `hasHandler` check in `isHubInteractive`. |
| 14 | `RoomPage`'s host-detection logic had no direct test guarding the regression fixed in `7db1b0a`. A future refactor could silently re-break it. | `c5334ee` — extracted `computeCanSpin(snapshot)` with seven cases (anyone, host_only host, host_only guest, unknown user_id, `-1` sentinel, turn_based host, turn_based guest). |
| 15 | BotFather had two Direct Link Mini Apps (`spin` and `play`); only `play` matched `VITE_TELEGRAM_APP_SHORT_NAME`. | `0756782` — `spin` deleted in BotFather + docs aligned. |
| 17 | Top-of-room Share Button (`Button[size=md]` with localized text) overflowed the right edge on iPhone X. Math: `RoomCodePill ~220 px + Button[UK] ~167 px + gap-3 12 px + px-4 32 px ≈ 431 px` vs 375 px viewport. | `7e21a85` — converted to `IconButton` (48×48 📤, aria-label routed through `t('room:actions.share')`). Frees ~80–100 px in every locale. |
| 18 | Wheel animation lags on iPhone X (A11, iOS 16); smooth on iPhone 14 (A15). High-suspicion cause: `feGaussianBlur` ring-glow filter that WebKit on A11-class chips rasterizes on CPU every frame. | `33a976b` — replaced filter with three stacked solid strokes (18/12/6 px at decreasing opacity). Same visual silhouette, pure compositor path. **Pending real-device verification.** |
| 19 | Flying reactions appeared at random horizontal positions — 🔥 didn't emerge from where the 🔥 button is in the bar. `stores/room.ts` set `x: Math.random()` on every incoming reaction. | `798788f` — new `apps/webapp/src/features/rooms/reactionLanes.ts` (`REACTION_EMOJIS` + `reactionLaneFor`) maps each emoji to a fixed lane that aligns with its button on phone widths; callers add ±2.5 % jitter so identical bursts don't pixel-stack. Five unit tests. |
| 20 | `RoomCodePill` default (`text-3xl + tracking-[0.35em] + px-7 py-4`) rendered at ~220 px — ~58 % of an iPhone X viewport on its own. Disproportionate vs the wheel below. | `6dbfbe0` — default tightened to `text-2xl + tracking-[0.3em] + px-6 py-3` (~175 px). Still hero-prominent, no longer dominating. |

### Hands-on verification — pending owner sign-off

The unit tests for items 12–15, 17–18 pass (43 frontend / 102 backend,
all gates green). What still needs a real-device pass:

```
Device A (host, iPhone 14 or newer):
  1. Quick Wheel → spin. After settle, the hub itself should still
     glow and show SPIN — a tap should kick off a fresh spin without
     going through the lower button. (Item 12.)
  2. Close the result overlay. The hub should remain interactive in
     the same way. (Item 12.)
  3. Create a room, change spin_policy back to host_only via the API
     (no UI yet — Stage B). On Device B (guest), the hub should not
     show SPIN, should not glow, should not be tappable. (Item 13.)
  4. Enter /room/<CODE>. The 📤 share button MUST sit fully inside
     the viewport on both Device A and Device B, in EN and in UK
     (the long "Поділитись" label is now in aria-label, not on
     screen, so locale should be irrelevant). (Item 17.)
  5. Tap each reaction emoji in turn — the corresponding emoji should
     rise from approximately above its own button (no longer random).
     Tap 🔥 five times rapidly; the five 🔥 should cluster around the
     🔥 lane with a small visible spread (jitter), not stack on the
     same pixel. (Item 19.)
  6. The room code pill at the top must look proportional next to the
     wheel and the share button — not dominating. (Item 20.)

Device B (guest in host_only room):
  7. After Device A spins, the guest can still react. (No regression.)
  8. Reactions sent by Device A also emerge from their own bar lane
     on Device B (the lane is computed client-side from the emoji,
     so the relayed events look identical). (Item 19.)

Device C (iPhone X / A11, iOS 16 — the device that surfaced item 18):
  9. Trigger a spin. The wheel must rotate smoothly through decelerate
     and settle without visible stutter. Acceptable: same subjective
     feel as iPhone 14. Unacceptable: dropped frames, jank, "hangs"
     during decelerate. (Item 18.)
 10. If step 9 still stutters: next levers — drop the inner-grad
     full-disc radial overlay inside the rotating motion.g, then drop
     wheel_tick audio rate from 12/s to 6/s. Both changes are
     local to apps/webapp/src/features/wheel/Wheel.tsx.
```
